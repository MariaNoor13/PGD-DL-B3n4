2 essential freatues of NN:
- incremental, layer-by-layer way in which increasingly complex representations are developed,
- these intermediate incremental representations are learned jointly

DL era trigger:
-better compute capability
-Big data (data is Fuel for DL)
-Algorithms advances
>better activation functions
>better weight initialization schemes
>better optimization schemes

Reason DL expected to sustain winter
-Simplicity
-scalability
-verstality and reusability
